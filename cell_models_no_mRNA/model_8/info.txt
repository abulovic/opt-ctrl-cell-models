Ribosome R, and chaperone C.
Enzyme is produced in unfolded form and can fold spontaneously
or through the action of the chaperone (nu_CH).
Enzyme can aggregate, and can be disaggregated by the chaperone,
or degraded by the protease.
Chaperone also serves to fold 10% of the house keeping protein HP.
Metabolite B kept at constant levels.
