Ribosome R, and chaperone C.
Two types of enzyme are produced in unfolded form.
E_sf (spontaneously folding) can fold spontaneously, but the other type of enzyme,
E_ca (chaperone assisted) requires chaperone for folding.
Both enzymes can aggregate, and can be disaggregated by the chaperone.
Chaperone also serves to fold 10% of the house keeping protein HP.
Metabolite B kept at constant levels.
